<div class="grid">
 <h2>Scale</h2>
 <p>The font sizes are based upon a <a href="https://gist.github.com/morganfeeney/0dc92d8368787a4a260fb8c002dfeb8d" taget="_blank">typographic scale</a> traditionally set by printers, adopted for use on the web. The sizes were originally in
  <em>point</em> yet have been converted to
  <em>rem</em> — the resulting size is the equivalent
  <em>px</em> to what it would have been as
  <em>point</em>. The base font size is
  <em>1rem</em>, with a line-height of
  <em>1</em>. The baseline grid is
  <em>.5rem</em> for the sake of traversing the baseline in small increments. The resulting body font size is — for small viewports 16px — whilst 18px on larger viewports as all font sizes scale up by 112.5%.</p>
 <h2>Names</h2>
 <p>The traditional names associated with letterpress sizes lend themselves as a naming convention for web typography. Take for example the variable names where I have assigned the font sizes in figure 1.</p>
 <p>Font sizes have been assigned to specific elements <code class="code-inline language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;</code>...<code class="code-inline language-markup">&lt;h6&gt;</code> using variables and the <a href="baseline.html">baseline</a> mixin, in the case
  of styles for the current Interior theme. However they could also be used for class names.</p>
