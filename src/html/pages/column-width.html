    <p class="js-type-body type-body">Column width not only creates a definite structure for laying out documents, it aids legibility. 
    The well-known rule of 7-10 words per line can be used as a metric for deciding upon a suitable line-length for layout, after all, it aims to rid the fatigue reading long copy creates over time. 
    The combination of using non-fluid screen sizes, with columns based on line-length will also add a tremendous level of certainty.

      Here we can see how well 12pt will read based on the line-length. It's not ideal for long copy due to it's size, 
      however I can use it for captions.

      Body copy is set to 16pt/24pt, the ideal line-length appears in the 3rd row.

      Selecting a column width that makes text pleasant to read is one of the most important typographic problems; 
      almost circular in nature, due to all of its factors (font-size, line-height &amp; column-width) needing consideration even though they may not appear in order.
     <br>Without going into great detail, the 7-10 words per line rule exists to prevent the readerâ€™s eye from becoming tired.
     It is difficult to follow a long line of text, to its end, and then search for the start of the next line when you go past 10 words. 
     Equally frustrating can be the <a href="/pages/line-height.html">line-height</a>, too high and there is a very similar problem.</p>
