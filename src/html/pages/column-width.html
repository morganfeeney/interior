    <p class="js-type-body type-body">Column width not only creates a definite structure for laying out documents, it aids legibility. 
    The well-known rule of 7-10 words per line can be used as a metric for deciding upon a suitable line-length for layout, after all, it aims to rid the fatigue reading long copy creates over time. 
    The combination of using non-fluid screen sizes, with columns based on line-length will also add a tremendous level of certainty.

    Without going into great detail, the 7-10 words per line rule exists to prevent the readerâ€™s eye from becoming tired.
     It is difficult to follow a long line of text, to its end, and then search for the start of the next line when you go past 10 words. 
     Equally frustrating can be the <a href="/pages/line-height.html">line-height</a>, too high and there is a very similar problem.</p>
