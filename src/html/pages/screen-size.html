      <p>For the initial exercise I discovered the following sizes to be the most popular, 
      via Google Analytics (listed in order of size):</p>
      <ul class="list-number">
        <li>320x568</li>
        <li>360x640</li>
        <li>375x667</li>
        <li>414x736</li>
        <li>768x1024</li>
        <li>1366x768</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Some of the sizes are considered “standard”, 
    such as the screen size for an iPad in portrait orientation (768x1024), 
    or the size for a standard Android device (360x640). 
    The web is constantly evolving and that could affect this kind of list; accept that things could change in future.
    However, my analysis covered over 1 year and the list of popular sizes did not change during that period.
