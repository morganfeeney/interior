  <h2>Using the grid</h2>
  <p>As I detailed in <a href="http://codepen.io/morganfeeney/post/dont-build-bootstrap-style-grid-systems-with-flexbox" target="_blank">this article</a>,
   what I learnt from the first incarnation of Interior — that was based on Bootstrap — is I had to walk away from what came before,
    and embrace new CSS layout tools. Interior v.2 doesn't rely on floats for layout, it never will, <em>I just need to create a grid and gutters, flexbox does the rest</em>.
    So that's how Interior v2. works; you won't find any <code class="code-inline language-scss">.col-[whatever]</code> classes or <code class="code-inline language-scss">.push</code>, <code class="code-inline language-scss">.pull</code> or <code class="code-inline language-scss">.offset</code> classes like you get in Bootstrap...
    <em>well you might</em> but if they exist they'll be for baseline alignment.</p>

  <p>Who knows what I will learn from the new Grid spec and what Interior v.3 will be, I'm guessing there may not be a need to use Interior for grid layout, yet there will be a benefit to automation using Scss — so it will live on — albeit <em>in a state of evolution</em>.</p>
  <h5>Columns &amp; gutters</h5>
  <p>In an effort to reduce the amount of markup necessary to create columns with gutters I opted for the use of margin over padding. This means to create a gutter and to apply a background to the content within it that is padded, so you can actually see the gutter, this means less code.</p>
<figure class="visual-grid-1 gutter-demo">
  <div>
    <div>{{ images.image_placeholder(size="500x100",text="IMG", bgcolor="ffbdbd", color="FF7070")}}</div>
    <div>This is text is to demonstrate the padding applied to this column. This is text is to demonstrate the padding applied to this column.</div>

  <h2>Separation</h2>
  <p>Keeping markup and presentation separate makes life easier going forward. There are many benefits, the primary benefit being that changes can be made using <strong><u>only</u></strong> CSS.</p>
  <h5>Don't set things in stone</h5>
  <p>Describing in markup the appearance of anything limits what may be altered later.</p>
  <h6>Example</h6>
  <div class="grid layout-1">
    <div>
      <p>In figure 1 the classes are descriptive of how many columns they span. This is fine until something requires an update, if the width needs to change you have no choice—if you want your markup to be semantic—but to change the markup.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <figure>
        {% include "../partials/code-samples/col-scss-set-in-stone.njk" %}
      <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
  </div>
  {# Choice #}
  <h5>Choice</h5>
  <div class="grid layout-1">
    <div>
      <p>You could either change both HTML and CSS, change HTML only—but be limited by existing styles—or change CSS only.</p>
      <h6>Example</h6>
      <p>If you keep your markup <strong>generic</strong> this change could be a matter of updating the CSS only. In figure 2 the generic <code class="code-inline language-markup">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag replaces the specific <code class="code-inline language-markup">&lt;div class="col-4"&gt;</code> &amp; <code class="code-inline language-markup">&lt;div class="col-6"&gt;</code> tags.</p>
    </div>

        {% include "../partials/code-samples/col-scss-layout-1.njk" %}
      <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
