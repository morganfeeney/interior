    <p class="intro">I wrote <a href="http://codepen.io/morganfeeney/post/dont-build-bootstrap-style-grid-systems-with-flexbox" target="_blank">this article</a>
     to document and explain what I learnt during previous iterations of Interior. The main lesson was to question <em>everything</em>.</p>
      <h5>Possibilities</h5>
    <p>There's point in the article where I state that I will be documenting standards, the idea there was not to get too bogged down with specifics <em>such as naming conventions</em>,
      but more along the lines of suggesting possibilities, not prescribing specific layoutsâ€”a demonstration of something different.</p>
